# overview
winkill lets you temporarily disable the windows key on your keyboard without rebooting your computer. 
This is useful if you're always hitting the windows key when playing games. (yes, i know not everyone does this, but some of us do)
Click the winkill icon in the system tray to use it as a system-wide windows key disabler or toggle it on/off with the "pause"/"break" key
To exit completely right click on the icon and choose exit.

# building

1. install Visual Studio 2022 for C++ (the Community Edition should work fine)
2. open WinKill.sln
3. compile and run

# screenshots

there's not much to it -- just a tray icon!
